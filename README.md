# Internship_Tasks

This repository contains my completed tasks for the FutureIntern Internship Program. The tasks focus on hands-on cybersecurity exercises, including email analysis, network traffic sniffing, and password cracking. The goal was to learn practical security testing techniques and understand common vulnerabilities in web applications.

## Tasks Completed

**Task 1: Email Analysis** (`Task1.md`)  
  Performed detailed analysis of a sample email using MXToolbox to identify red flags, such as suspicious links, SPF/DKIM/DMARC results, and phishing indicators. The findings and recommendations are documented in the Task1 report.

 **Task 2: Wireshark Sniffing** (`Task2.md`)  
  Captured and analyzed network traffic using Wireshark while interacting with the vulnerable web application [testphp.vulnweb.com](http://testphp.vulnweb.com/). Intercepted HTTP packets revealed credentials in plain text, highlighting the risks of unsecured HTTP connections. Full analysis is in Task2 report.

 **Task 3: Password Cracking with John the Ripper** (`Task3.md`)  
  *(Pending)* Will involve extracting password hashes from the target site and cracking them using John the Ripper to demonstrate the importance of strong password policies.
